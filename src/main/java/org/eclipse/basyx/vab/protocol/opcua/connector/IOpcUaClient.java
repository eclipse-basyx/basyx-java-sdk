/**
 * Very simplified OPC UA client interface for reading and writing node values and invoking methods.
 *
 * <h2>How to use</h2>
 *
 * This interface features a set of methods to call common OPC UA services on a server (e.g. to read
 * a node). Each comes in a synchronous and an asynchronous variant, returning
 * {@link CompletableFuture}s. When any of these methods is first called, a connection to the
 * configured endpoint URL is automatically opened.
 * <p>
 * Users can configure the client through {@link #setConfiguration(ClientConfiguration)} until the
 * first connection attempt is made. After that point, that method will throw an exception. <br>
 * {@link #hasConnected()} lets users check whether such a connection attempt has already been made.
 *
 * <h2>Regarding types</h2>
 *
 * This interface must necessarily translate between two distinct type systems. There is the
 * {@link ValueType BaSyx type system} on the one hand, itself a mapping of XML Schema types to
 * standard JDK types with some additional custom classes. And on the other hand, there is
 * <a href="https://reference.opcfoundation.org/v104/Core/docs/Part5/12.2">OPC UA's type system</a>.
 * The two aren't fully compatible, meaning that there isn't a simple one-to-one mapping of types.
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation makes no attempt at complete coverage of all OPC UA types. Only a subset of
 * the most common data types are supported. Below table shows which Java types can be used and what
 * OPC UA type they map to. Callers can pass these types to any of the interface methods and expect
 * these types to be returned.
 *
 * <p>
 * Please note that if the OPC UA server returns a value of a different type than those listed in
 * the table, e.g. as the result of a read operation or method invocation, then that type will be
 * returned from the API as is. It would likely be a class from the underlying OPC UA library and
 * the caller would have to know how to handle that type.

 * <i>5 minutes</i> without any information on the hour or seconds. Such date/time specifications
 * are not supported by the OPC UA DateTime type. It functions like the {@link java.time.Instant}
 * type and must always specify a precise moment in time.
